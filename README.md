Welcome to Riccardo test on Hugo + Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/05edf93f-0b88-45b2-a166-318956c87756/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/timely-bombolone-ae5bc6/deploys)


Currently it all works locally, but in the cloud... (seems the beginning of a fun PEBCAK story)...
I got 404.

WTF is the  /index.html ?!?

The working version has:
* basedir: not set.
* build command: hugo
* publish directory: public
